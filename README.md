# Android E-Commerce App with Firebase Firestore

This repository contains my implementation of an Android E-Commerce App developed as part of the "[Android Firebase Firestore - Masterclass - Build a Shop App](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-firebase-firestore-masterclass-build-a-shop-app/)" course by [Denis Panjuta](https://www.udemy.com/user/denispanjuta/). The app is built from scratch using Google Firebase Firestore as the primary NoSQL database.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Integrated Firebase authentication module allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Listing**: Display a range of products available for purchase, fetched from Firestore.
- **Cloud Storage**: Used Firebase's cloud storage to store and retrieve product images and user avatars.
- **Cart & Checkout**: Implemented shopping cart functionality with real-time database syncing.
- **Notifications**: Integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time notifications to users.

## Technologies Used

- **Firebase Firestore**: For real-time NoSQL database.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For user sign-up and login.
- **Firebase Cloud Storage**: For storing media files like product images.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: For real-time notifications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your Firebase project and link it to this app.
3. Update the `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory.
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or real device.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I've gained a deeper understanding of:

- The intricacies of Firebase Firestore and how to structure NoSQL data efficiently.
- Implementing user authentication in Android apps.
- Managing and syncing data in real-time across users.
- Implementing and managing cloud storage for media files.
- Sending and managing real-time notifications to users.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a user review and rating system for products.
- Incorporating advanced search and filter options.
- Adding a recommendation engine based on user purchase history.

## Contributions

While this project was primarily for learning purposes, I'm open to suggestions, improvements, and collaborations. Feel free to fork, raise issues, or submit pull requests.
